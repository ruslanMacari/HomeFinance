 * Lombok will eventually automatically add this annotation to all generated constructors, methods, fields, and types.
 * 
 * You can mark the presence of this annotation as 'ignore it' for all code style and bug finding tools.
 * <p>
 * NB: As of v1.16.2 which introduces this annotation, lombok doesn't actually add this annotation; we're setting
 * it up so that lombok jars in widespread use start having this, which will make it easier to actually apply it
 * later on.
